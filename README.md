# Dev Hire

`Dev Hire` is an open source website I created for my portfolio site as a way for a client to setup an appointment with me for freelance work. I'm using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS to create this project.

* Stripe - To make or receive payments over the internet.
* Foreman - Allows a user to use multiple procfiles in a Ruby on Rails application. Foreman will startup Redis, Sidekiq, and the Rails Server for you.
* Tailwind CSS - A CSS framework which is different from frameworks such as Bootstrap which give the site a different feel.
* Webpacker to manage app like JavaScript modules in Ruby on Rails.
